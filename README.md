There are a few bugs, which cause it to crash, but it stays working for long enough that you can relaunch it. Also I cannot be bothered to go and debug this.

Works on MacOS Ventura 13.1
Not tested on Windows

To run, you might need to change the names of some of the directories (because I've used my own), but after that, running main.py should run the program.
